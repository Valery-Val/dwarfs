### Predictive Analysis for Order Defaults in Dwarfish Taverns
In dwarfish communities, there's a recurring phenomenon: dwarfs frequently leave their wallets at home when visiting local taverns, intending to settle their bills the following day. 
However, certain instances result in unpaid dues, leading to financial instability for these establishments. 
To address this, we leverage historical transaction data to predict the likelihood of an order default.

#### Objective
Utilize machine learning to develop a predictive model that determines the default probability of orders based on historical tavern transactions across various dwarf settlements.

#### Approach 
Our modeling journey encompassed a variety of algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and LightGBM. 
Feature engineering played a pivotal role in enhancing model performance.
